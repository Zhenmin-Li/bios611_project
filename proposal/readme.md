# Introduction:

2020 US presidential election is one of the impactful events in the world. And whether the current president, Donald Trump, will win the election and still serve as US president is hard to predict. In this case it is important to know his attitude toward the 2020 election. I want to do some sentiment analysis on Donald Trump’s tweets during 2016 and 2020 election and see if there’s any changes.


# Description of dataset:

For this project, I will use Donald Trump’s tweets in the year of 2020 and 2016 before election. I will only use two properties: content of the tweets for data mining and date for filter. I will probably use Twitter API to get more data if I need some other properties (e.g. who will be retweeted by Trump).

This dataset has 20 versions till now. The latest version contains tweets from 7/18/2020 to 10/8/2020. I cannot download the previous version now so I cannot get the data prior to 7/18 in 2020.
In the previous version it use a different format which contains all the trump's tweets from 2019. So I can get the data in 2016.

# Preliminary Figures:

This is the top 20 of most used terms by Trump in 2016 and 2020.

# Questions:

What is the difference of sentiment for Trump’s tweets in 2016 and 2020?

How did his sentiment change according to time series? And why? (Are there any representative words can reflect this changing?)

How was Trump’s attitude toward some of the trending news and celebrities? (e.g. Joe Biden, COVID-19 …Which words has the highest co-occurrence with these words? And what was the sentiment these words stand for?)


# Modeling:


A popular visualization in sentiment analysis (and other NLP tasks) is WordCloud. It will be a figure like the following one.

And maybe I can visualize the changing of sentiment like the following one. This one is real time. I think a real time one is too complex for me but a line chart and labels sounds like what I can do.

# Criteria:

These is lots of things I can do with this dataset. At least I shall complete the first two questions, with a clear model use for sentiment analysis and some figures to present the results.

Then I can continue with the third one and perhaps other potential questions. (e.g. Who will likely be retweeted by Trump? What is the sentiment of these tweets?)
